NachosEngine is a small graphics engine I developed to learn how OpenGL works. The project requires the following dll to run: SDL, glew and Assimp. The project also uses glm and stb.
The engine is featured in a small game inspired by the old “Track & Field” arcade game developed by konami. Use keys Q and E alternatively to move player1 and left and right arrows to move player 2. The camera will follow player 1.
Implementations:
